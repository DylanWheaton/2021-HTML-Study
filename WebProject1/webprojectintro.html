Pearl Harbor was an important naval base for the US pacific fleet holding most of the pacific fleet. <br />
At the time having a strong navy was vital to maintaining your countries status in the world. <br />
Having a fleet meant projecting your power across the waves and keeping other countries in check. <br />

Seeing this it is obvious why the Japanese would choose to attack such a target as a well cordinated strike could cripple the Pacific fleet allow the Japanese to commence operations as they wish. <br />
