The Arizona a ship capable of destruction beyond what many could attain or imagine a ship made to withstand the same destructive power it dished out. <br />
Unfortunately it's power was to never be used against enemies of the United States as it sunk to the bottom of the harbor the pride of US fleet was no more. <br />
